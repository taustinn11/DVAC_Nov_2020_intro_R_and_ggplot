1. Download R *for the first time*- download 4.0.3
https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/
> Choose 'Download R for ___ (OS)' depending on what you have
## For Windows
> Choose the bolded link 'install R for the first time.'
> Choose the 'Download R 4.0.3 for Windows' and run the installer after it's done downloading

## For Mac
> Choose R-4.0.3.pkg and run once installed
>> If you have a legacy OS X system for your Mac, look for the version that is compatible with your current OS version. To note, R version 3.6.3 should be compatible with our demo. I have not tried R version 3.3.3, but it should also be compatible.

1.2 Update R (if you have it previously installed)
Here is a great walkthrough with pictures: https://www.r-statistics.com/2015/06/a-step-by-step-screenshots-tutorial-for-upgrading-r-on-windows/
> Open R from the terminal or from RGui (NOT RStudio)
> Code: install.packages("installr")
# this ensures that you have this package installed. If it asks you which CRAN mirror to use, pick one of the ones for the U.S. I like the one based in TN.
> Code: installr::updateR()
# It will prompt you with a window showing your current version and what the newer version is along with the release dates for both.
> Navigate through the windows to download the newest version of R
> After the installer is downloaded, select your language, accept the terms, and choose a directory for your R folder to live. It is fine to allow the default option. Importantly, if you have your other R folder in a different directory, try to save this R folder in that directory - This will help with copying your old packages to your new version of R. 
> Note: you may be able to find where your current R is by opening your Terminal or Bash terminal and typing 'where R'. This works on GitBash for Windows as long as R is in your PATH. If you can't find where the old R folder is saved, it's not a big deal. Just save the new R folder in a directory that you like -- the packages can be re-installed when you need to use them
> After this, answer the questions about if you want to copy your old packages over and if you want to keep the old packages installed on your previous version -- I think this is a good idea since you may want to switch back a version if you're doing a particular project (this is very easy)
# Note: This may take awhile

2. Download Rstudio - download version 1.3.1093 for your OS
