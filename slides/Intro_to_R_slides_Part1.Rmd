## Goals for this workshop {.build .smaller}

- To give a brief introduction to R and explain why you should use it

- To prepare you directly to use R with real biological data

   - Load data and perform simple data manipulations

   - Create high quality custom plots

   - Bonus: write scripts that automate these two processes
      - Builds off of the previous DVAC workshop "Terminal Commands and Bash Scripts"

- To establish a foundation from which you can continue to learn R


- There will be resources included on the Github page (https://github.com/taustinn11/DVAC_Nov_2020_intro_R_and_ggplot)

## What is R? What does R do?{.build}

- R is an object-oriented programming language developed by statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (https://www.r-project.org/about.html)
  - Robert Gentleman is also the originator of the Bioconductor Project (Gentleman et al. 2004)
  - R is used heavily in the academic community (particularly in biology) as well in industry settings (see https://github.com/ThinkR-open/companies-using-r)

- R has a TON of applications beyond biostatistics and biological data visualization 
  - Scraping web data & interacting with databases/APIs
  - Building apps, reports, and other software products
  - Plotting of different kinds of data in a variety of ways 
  - Developing machine learning models
  
## Why should I use R (or any programming language)? {.smaller}

- **Reproducibility and Efficiency**
  - Every step *should be* recorded in your script ensuring analysis documentation and reproducibility
  - A well-written script is reusable 
    - Less time doing "prep analysis" work and more time considering the results
- Scalability and Extensibility
  - R can handle all kinds of data (images, text, tabular, unstructured) and all sizes of data
  - R has over 10,000 packages for different statistical, plotting, mapping, and software development applications
- Free, open source, and **high quality**
  - Free & Open Source = Huge R community = support and rigor
  - **Publication quality plots**
    - Fun fact: BBC News uses R for static plots <font size="2"> (source: https://medium.com/bbc-visual-and-data-journalism/how-the-bbc-visual-and-data-journalism-team-works-with-graphics-in-r-ed0b35693535) </font>

```{r echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressMessages(library(knitr))
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# Data in two numeric vectors
women_weight <- c(38.9, 61.2, 73.3, 21.8, 63.4, 64.6, 48.4, 48.8, 48.5)
men_weight <- c(67.8, 60, 63.4, 76, 89.4, 73.3, 67.3, 61.3, 62.4) 
# Create a data frame
weight_data <- data.frame( 
                group = rep(c("Woman", "Man"), each = 9),
                weight = c(women_weight,  men_weight)
                )
```

## A short demonstration {.build}

Simple calculations

```{r echo= TRUE}
2+2
6^6
mean(c(6, 9, 10, 15, 8, 3, 6))
```

## A short demonstration {.build .smaller}

Stores data for viewing, manipulating, and performing statistical tests on

```{r echo = TRUE, out.height=4}
slice(.data = weight_data, 8:11) #showing a small slice of my weight data
t.test(weight~group, weight_data)
```

## A short demonstration {.build .smaller}

For plotting

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=6, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(weight_data, aes(x = group, y = weight))+
  geom_boxplot()+geom_point()+theme_bw()+
  ggtitle("My Made Up Weight Data")
```

## Scope of this workshop {.smaller}

- We are going to focus on reading data, modifying data, and plotting data
- Importantly, there are too many considerations to discuss when selecting a statistical test to cover today
  - Statistics will be a future workshop topic 
  - You can message DVAC for statistics advice if you have a specific case or question (regardless of whether you are using R or not)
- We are going to bypass several key fundamentals of R programming
  - This is a calculated decision to get you straight to working with **your data** and plotting **your data** without spending time on features you may not need necessarily
  - If you want to continue learning R, checkout the Github page (https://github.com/taustinn11/DVAC_Nov_2020_intro_R_and_ggplot)
    - Start with immediate files and links in the additional_resources/ folder  
    - Follow this with the stuff in additional_resources/extra/

## What does object-oriented mean?{.build .smaller}

- In R, data are stored as 'objects' and have 'data types'
  - 'Data types' are the kind of value a data point is
    - Age (e.g. 26) is "numeric" while Name (e.g. "Austin") is of type "character"
  - An 'object' is data that is organized into a structure and assigned a name
    - A single value (which is considered a vector of size 1), a vector of values, a 2D table (data frame or a matrix), a list, etc. The data in an object can be of any type.
    - I could combine the Age and Name variables into a data frame and name it zoom_meeting_table

```{r}
Age <- c(26, 24, 26)
Name <- c("Austin", "Jess", "Logan")
zoom_meeting_table <- data.frame(Name, Age)
zoom_meeting_table
```


## What are the data objects in R {.build .smaller}

![](../planning/data_types_highlighted.png){width=80%}
    
- We are going to primarily use **data frames and vectors**
  - This represents 'tabular' data aka data in table form
  - It is most similar to what you would organize in Microsoft Excel

```{r}
class(weight_data)
class(weight_data$group);class(weight_data$weight)
```

## A Quick Note about Tidy Data

- Briefly, tidy data is a principle by which you try to record your data and keep it in "tidy" format
  - Being tidy means that each variable has it's own column and isn't spread unnecessarily
    - https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf
  - This workshop is going to operate under the assumption that **you will put in tidy data**. You can clean untidy data, but to do so is beyond the scope of this workshop
  - I've included an example of what untidy vs tidy data looks like:
