## Goals for this presentation {.build .smaller}


- To give a brief introduction to R

- To prepare you directly to use R with real biological data

   - Load data and perform simple data manipulations

   - Create high quality custom plots

   - Bonus: write scripts that automate these two processes 

- To establish a foundation from which you can continue to learn R


- There will be resources included on the Github page (https://github.com/taustinn11/DVAC_Nov_2020_intro_R_and_ggplot)

## What is R? What does R do?{.build}

- R is an object-oriented programming language built by statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman
  - Robert Gentleman is also an originator of the Bioconductor Project
  - R is used heavily in the academic community (particularly in biology) as well in industry settings

- R has a TON of applications ranging from performing simple calculations, to exploring data, to performing statistical tests, to plotting, to scraping data, to building web apps, etc., etc.

```{r include=FALSE}
# Data in two numeric vectors
women_weight <- c(38.9, 61.2, 73.3, 21.8, 63.4, 64.6, 48.4, 48.8, 48.5)
men_weight <- c(67.8, 60, 63.4, 76, 89.4, 73.3, 67.3, 61.3, 62.4) 
# Create a data frame
weight_data <- data.frame( 
                group = rep(c("Woman", "Man"), each = 9),
                weight = c(women_weight,  men_weight)
                )
```

## What is R? What does R do?{.build}

Simple calculations

```{r echo= TRUE}
2+2
6^6
mean(c(6, 9, 10, 15, 8, 3, 6))
```

## What is R? What does R do?{.build .smaller}

Stores data for viewing, manipulating, and performing statistical tests on

```{r echo = TRUE, out.height=4}
weight_data[8:11,] #showing a small slice of my weight data
t.test(weight~group, weight_data)
```

## What is R? What does R do?{.build .smaller}

For plotting

```{r echo =  FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressMessages(library(knitr))
```

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=6, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(weight_data, aes(x = group, y = weight))+
  geom_boxplot()+geom_point()+theme_bw()+
  ggtitle("My Made Up Weight Data")
```

## Why should I use R (or any programming language)? {.smaller}

- Reproducibility and Efficiency
  - Every calculation is recorded in your script file, so you or others can review what steps you took and/or try to reproduce your findings
  - A well-written script can accept and analyze fresh data meaning you spend less time doing "prep analysis" work and more time considering the results
- Scalability and Extensibility
  - R can all kinds and all sizes of data
  - R has over 10,000 packages for all kinds of statistical, plotting, mapping, or software development applications
- Free, open source, and produces high quality results
  - Being free and open source, R has a huge community that supports itself and ensures that code and analyses are rigorous and without mistake
  - Plots rendered in R are publication quality
    - Fun fact: BBC News uses R for static plots published in their articles <font size="2"> (source: https://medium.com/bbc-visual-and-data-journalism/how-the-bbc-visual-and-data-journalism-team-works-with-graphics-in-r-ed0b35693535) </font>

## Scope of this workshop

- We are going to focus on reading data, modifying data, and plotting data
- Importantly, performing statistical tests in R is a bit beyond the scope of someone just starting with R
- Statistics will be a future workshop topic 
  - Also, you can message DVAC for statistics advice if you have a specific case or question (regardless of whether you are using R or not)

## What does object-oriented mean?{.build}

- In R, data are stored as 'objects' and have 'data types'
  - 'Data types' are the kind of value a data point is. For example, age in years (e.g. 26) is of type "numeric" while a name (e.g. "Austin") is of type "character"
  - An object can be a single value (which is considered a vector of size 1), a vector of values, a 2D table, a list of 2D tables, etc. The data in an object can be of any type
- These data objects have a **class** (e.g. vector, matrix, list, etc.) based on the structure of the values and corresponding **attributes** based on the 'data type'
- Functions in R are coded to interact with objects in specific ways depending on their class and attributes
  
## What does object-oriented mean?{.build}
  
```{r}
# You can save any data as an object to be called by name later
lbs_to_kg <- 1/2.22
# "<-" is used to assign names to data
lbs_to_kg
```

```{r}
my_weight_lbs <- 180
my_weight_kgs <- my_weight_lbs*lbs_to_kg
my_weight_kgs
```

## What does object-oriented mean? {.build .smaller}

```{r}
weight_data$weight #this is a variable from our data.frame called weight_data
# It has a class of 'numeric vector' | it looks like it's in kg already!
```

```{r}
weight_data$weight_lbs <- weight_data$weight*(1/lbs_to_kg)
head(weight_data, 5)
```
```{r}
methods("mean")
```

## What are the data objects in R

    -  Note: Atomic vector just refers to 'vector'

- We are going to primarily use data frames and vectors
  - This represents 'tabular' data aka data in table form
  - It is most similar to what you would organize in Microsoft Excel

## Tidy Data

- Briefly, tidy data is a principle by which you try to record your data and keep it in "tidy" format
  - Being tidy means that each variable has it's own column and isn't spread unnecessarily
  - This tutorial is going to work under the assumption that **you put in tidy data**. You can clean untidy data, but to do so is beyond the scope of this workshop
  - I've included an example of what untidy vs tidy data looks like:
